# academics
Reserved repository to list a little of my academic life

### academics projects
- [Labyrinth](https://github.com/jpstayfocus/academics/blob/main/acad-projects-code/labyrinth.py) - source code can be only testes using codeboot.
  - [codeboot](https://codeboot.org/4.1.1/#!) is an online programming environment geared towards novices with no prior programming experience. This environment supports the JavaScript and Python languages and thus allows teaching imperative programming concepts as well as functional programming concepts. Documentation can be found [here](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~feeley/papers/MelanconFeeleyTFPIE21.pdf)


### courses taken
